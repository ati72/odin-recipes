    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 slice onion</li>
        <li>4 whole cloves</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, 
            onion, cloves and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, 
            and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. 
            Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a 
            large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
        </li>
        <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. 
            Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a 
            medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, 
            so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with 
            sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
